# Version 2 - Tile Creator Instructions
  **(written by our favourite teacher)**

  1. Clean up code - Kill the dummy =(
  2. Tile Obstacles - You are given a slightly less efficient way to create obstacles.
      You may read the example code, or you can code without it.
      Your task is to create the obstacles efficiently.

        - Create an obstacle.py and write the Obstacle class.
        - Create an obstacle_creator.py and write the class that creates obstacles.

      Hint:
      The code will be very similar to how we dealt with tiles.
