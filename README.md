# Level-3-Pygame
All Project World Creation code

## How to Navigate:
Go to >**Branches** (the dropdown that says "main" on the top left corner) and see all versions (Version 1 - Version 9.1),
each version will reference to Level 3 moodle instructions and my own steps.

Beyond Version 10 were lazily combined into Version - Final that contains enemy_files code and audio, etc.
(can't remember).

Some of the code, I did not follow instructions, I will refer my changes on the README.md files.
See >**Issues** for more details on my personal changes, I will also include my own coding issues there that I could not solve (soon).
