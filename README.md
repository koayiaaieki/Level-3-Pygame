# Level-3-Pygame
All worldbuilding code

## How to Navigate:
Go to >**Branches** (the dropdown that says "main" on the top left corner) and see all versions (Version 1 - Version 9.1),
each version will reference to Mr. Liu's moodle instructions and my own steps.

Beyond Version 10 were lazily combined into Version - Final that contains enemy_files code and audio, etc.
(can't remember)

Some of the code, I did not follow Mr. Liu's instructions, so if you want a more
detailed explanation of what I did in some parts, see >**Issues**. I will also put
out my own coding issues there that I could not solve.
