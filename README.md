# Version 2 - Tile Creator Instructions
  **(written by our favourite teacher)**

Our tile.py is currently inefficeint.
Every time we create a tile, the program will need to reload all the images for all the tile types.

1. We will update our Tile class to require an image to be passed in.
2. We will write a Tile_creator class to help us streamline the tile creating process.

### [Create]
Version 2.1 - [Update] tile.py

Version 2.2 - [Create] tile_creator.py
