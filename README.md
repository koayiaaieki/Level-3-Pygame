# Level-3-Pygame
All Project World Creation code

## How to Navigate:
Go to >**Branches** (the dropdown that says "main" on the top left corner) and see all versions (Version 1 - Version 9.1),
each version will reference to Level 3 moodle instructions and my own steps.

Beyond Version 10 were lazily combined into Version - Final that contains enemy_files code and audio, etc.
(can't remember)

Some of the code, I did not follow instructions, I will refer my changes on the README.md. 
See >**Issues** for more details on my personal changes, I will also include my own coding issues there that I could not solve.

## Downloading Code to VSCode:

1.) If you want to download the whole zips for the version you want to try out, create a completely
new folder in your desktop for all of my code only.

2.) This will make it slightly more convenient to separate my code from yours, so just open a new window
in VScode and have two separate windows to compare.

2.) Under the same folder you created, download the **assets** and **pics** folders. They must be
outside the Version Folders.

3.) All Downloads is right under >**Releases** at the right side of the screen.
